**Q: How long before profitability?**
A: 6-12 months if you get traction. Goal is $10k MRR by month 6.

**Q: Do I need to hire before launching?**
A: No. Launch solo/small team first. Prove traction, then scale the team.

**Q: What's the fastest path to $1M ARR?**
A: B2C ($10/mo @ 10% conversion) → B2B team licenses → Enterprise contracts.

**Q: Should I get funding before launching?**
